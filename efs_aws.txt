AWS EFS

Creating and maintaing file system is difficult hence this service is provided

provides simple, serverless and and elastic file system
lets you shared data without provisoining or managing storagge

Compared to AWS EBS, AWS EFS saves the data in many Availability Zones.

on prem ---- or ec2

application running on multiple ec2 instance can access efs file sysetm ssame time

EFS use currently network file system version 4 protocol

after you create file system you can mount it on ec2. 

no minimum fees and setup fees 

efs grows and shrinks as per data



when to use EFS


Type of storage

AWS EFS

used for application which required shared file system access by multiple system

application which access data through standard interface

scalability and reliabliity of cloud without writtig any new code


object storage  --- s3

application that do not rquired file storage structure and requires only objet storage

those type of application can use object storage

Massivly scalable cost optimized solution

block storage   --- ebs

data is broken into blocks and each block has unique id

example-:

enterprise application
containarize application
big data analysys


EFS / EBS 

Benifits

1000 of ec2 or on prem system can simultaneously access efs

in EBS only single EC2 instance can access ebs


1) Dyanmic Elasticity

 -- auatomcatic scale up or down storage capacity 
without distrubingt application
=== start adding file


2) fully manged by AWS
 --- simple interface , complexity is remove


3)cost effect

---- pay for what you use

4)security compliance

---- securlty access files like IAM,VPC

5) encrypt data while transmitting and data at rest


Uses cases of EFS

Machine learning and analytics --- easy of use , scale and performance

web serving and content marketing --- provide durable high throughtpu managment

application dev and testing ------ HA solution

media and entermainaint ---- depends on shared storage. high througut and shared access


Disadvatnage - EFS does not support windows

Lab-:

1)create security group --- one for instance

only allow ssh

2) now create another one -=== one for efs system

incoming TCP allowed --- port 0 source  0.0.0.0


3) Create file system

give name

sleect VPC

Click on customize

lifecyce managment if file not used for 30 days change storage class

next

network access under

select ec2 security group for all 3 az ( EC2 sg)

why we are creating in order for ec2 to access efs



create ec2 instance

login to instance. select security group

execute command on terimnal "df -T -h"

when you executed above command ec2 mounted on efs

you can also mount same way other ec2 instance and other ec2 can view files

How to connect to Database instance you created from ec2 instance


create Ec2 instance

select SG where incoming rule 3306 is allowed and remember endpoint ID of your database

create database of engine Maria and give initial name to database

on ec2 instance execute following command

sudo su

yum install mariadb-server

systemctl enable mariadb

system start mariadb


you need username,password and RDS endpoint

command to connect from ec2 to Database instance


mysql -h <endpoint id> -P 3306 -u rdsuser -p  --- provide password
 

you can connect from multiple EC2 instances to a single database instance (like an Amazon RDS instance) as 
long as they are configured within the same VPC and the database security group allows connections from all
 the EC2 instances' IP addresses; essentially, any number of EC2 instances can access the same database if 
properly configured with security group rules
